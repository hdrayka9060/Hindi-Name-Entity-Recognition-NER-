# Hindi Named Entity Recognition (NER) for News Articles

This project aims to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) specifically for Hindi language news articles. It utilizes machine learning techniques with PyTorch, Transformers, and Hugging Face's pre-trained models.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need:

- Python (version >= 3.6)
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- Hugging Face's `transformers` library
- Hindi language models from Hugging Face (cfilt/HiNER-original-muril-base-cased)

## Usage
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `HindiNer_Github(1).ipynb`

## Results
The performance of the NER model is manually evaluated on 20 hindi articles from differant publishers, resulted in f1 scor of 72%.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add new features, improve the code, or fix bugs, feel free to open a pull request.
